bits & bobs on OCR

pdfimages is fine for extracting scanned pages
  applications all(?) need 270 degree rotation; use
    pamflip -r270 xxx.ppm >xxx_rot.ppm
  pamflip is from GnuWin32 netpbm
  exhibits seem not to need rotation

use tesseract to process pages: can we detect when we need to rotate
  based on dictionary word count?
  we can also try different segmentation modes (e.g. sparse text)
